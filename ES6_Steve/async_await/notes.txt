Less "clever" and more readable.

- Use case
 Async functions are essentially a cleaner way to work with asynchronous code in JavaScript
 It is non blocking (just like promises and callbacks)

- Propose
Async/Await was created to simplify the process of working with and writing chained promises.

- What it does
Async functions return a Promise.
If the function throws an error, the Promise will be rejected.
If the function returns a value, the Promise will be resolved.

- Await
Async functions can make use of the await expression.
This will pause the async function and wait for the Promise to resolve prior to moving on.
